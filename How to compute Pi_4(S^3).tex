\title{How to Compute $\pi_4(S^3)$}
\author{David Zhu}

\begin{document}
\maketitle


In this exposition, we compute the first not-easily-computable homotopy group of spheres, $\pi_4(S^3)$. First we recall the definition for higher homotopy groups

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=purple!5!white,colframe=purple!75!black]
\begin{definition}
For $n>0$, the  $n$th homotopy group of a pointed topological space $(X,x_0)$, denoted by $\pi_n(X,x_0)$, is the group of homotopy classes of maps from $(I^n,\partial I^n)\to (X,x_0)$. Equivalently, it is also the group of homotopy classes of maps from $(S^n,s_0)\to (X,x_0)$. 
\end{definition}
\end{tcolorbox}
Note that when $n=0$, the homotopy classes of maps no longer form a group, but it is still well-defined as a set. Based on this definition, one might be tempted to think that $\pi_n(S^k)$ is trivial when $n>k$. However, the Hopf fibration $S^1\hookrightarrow S^3\to S^2$ gives us a non-trivial element of $\pi_3(S^2)$. It is generally very hard to compute higher homotopy groups, even for spheres except for a certain number of cases.

Without introducing any new tools, we can do at least one case: recall that a covering space $(\tilde{X},\tilde{x}_0)\to (X,x_0)$ satisfies the homotopy lifting property. In particular, the induced map $\pi_n(\tilde{X},\tilde{x}_0)\to \pi_n(X,x_0)$ is injective. On the other hand, the lifting criterion states that every map $S^n\to X$ can be lifted to $\Tilde{X}$ as $S^n$ is simply-connected for $n\geq 2$. Therefore, we have

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!30!white]
\begin{theorem}
A covering space projection $\tilde{X}\to X$ induces isomorphism on nth homotopy groups for $n\geq 2$.
\end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!5!white,colframe=green!30!white]
\begin{corollary}
    $\pi_n(S^1)=0$ for $n>1$
\end{corollary}
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{proof}
    Take $\mathbb{R}$ to be the universal cover for $S^1$, which has trivial homotopy groups since it is contractible.
\end{proof}

\section{Prelimary Results}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!30!white]
\begin{theorem}
(Cellular Approximation Theorem) Any map $f: X\to Y$ of CW-complexes is homotopic a cellular map, i.e the image of the $n$-skeleton of $X$ is contained in the $n$-skeleton of $Y$.
\end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!5!white,colframe=green!30!white]
\begin{corollary}
$\pi_n(S^k)=0$ for $k>n$.
\end{corollary}
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{proof}
    If the image of the map $\phi: S^n\to S^k$ the image misses a point $s_0\in S^k$, then $S^k-\{s_0\}$ is homotopy equivalent to $\mathbb{R}^{k}$, and continuous map into $\mathbb{R}^{k}$ is nullhomotopic. Equip $S^n$ with the CW structure of $2$ $k$-cell in each dimension $k$. Then, every map $\phi: S^n\to S^k$ is homotopic to a cellular map that is not surjective.
\end{proof}

The next result is very important to our discussion. 

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!30!white]
\begin{theorem}
(Hurewicz Theorem) A space $X$ is called \underline{\textbf{n-connected}} if $\pi_k(X)=0$ for all $0\leq k\leq n$. For $n\geq 2$, if $X$ is $n$-connected, then $\pi_n(X)\cong \tilde{H}_n(X)$.
\end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}
An immediate corollary of this result is that we can compute $\pi_n(S^n)$, which is generated by the degree map, as one might expect.
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!5!white,colframe=green!30!white]
\begin{corollary}
$\pi_n(S^n)\cong \mathbb{Z}$
\end{corollary}
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{proof}
    Combine the fact that $S^n$ is $n-1$-connected by Corollary $1.1.1$ and the fact that $H_n(S^n)=\mathbb{Z}$.
\end{proof}

Recall that a cofibration is a map $A\hookrightarrow X$ satisfying the homotopy extension property. Cofibration plays well with homology/cohomology as it gives us a long exact sequence, and we can then extract homological information from one space from the other. The dual notion is a fibration, which satisfies the homotopy lifiting property.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=purple!5!white,colframe=purple!75!black]
\begin{definition}
A map $E\to B$ is said to satisfy the \underline{\textbf{homotopy lifting property}} (HLP) with respect to a space $X$ if the following diagram commutes
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
X\times \{0\}\arrow[r,"\tilde{H}_0"]\arrow[d,"i"]&E\arrow[d]\\
X\times [0,1]\arrow[r,"H"]\arrow[ur,dashed,"\tilde{H}"]&B
\end{tikzcd}    
\]
In other words, given a homotopy in $H_t: X\to B$ and a initial lift $\tilde{H}_0: X\to E$, we can lift the homotopy entirely.
\end{definition}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=purple!5!white,colframe=purple!75!black]
\begin{definition}
A map $p:E\to B$ satisfying the HLP with respect to arbitrary $X$ is called a (Hurewicz)  \underline{\textbf{fibration}}. A map satisfying the HLP with respect to CW-complexes is called a \underline{\textbf{Serre fibration}}. Assume $B$ is path-connected and based at $b_0$, the \underline{\textbf{fiber}} of the fibration is $F=p^{-1}(b_0)\subseteq E$. We organize the data of a fibration into the following \underline{\textbf{Fiber Sequence}}
\[F\to E\to B\]
\end{definition}
\end{tcolorbox}
Note that covering maps are fibrations with discrete fibers. In practice, Serre fibrations is good enough to give us most of the desired properties/tools. It is fun to know that pathological examples exists (even in CGWH) where a Serre fibration is not a fibration. 

From now on we assume the base-space is path-connected.
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!30!white]
\begin{theorem}
Given a Serre fibration $p:E\to B$ with fiber $F$ and a choice $x_0\in F$, we have the following LES:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
...\arrow[r]&\pi_n(F,x_0)\arrow[r]&\pi_n(E,x_0)\arrow[r]&\pi_n(B,b_0)\arrow[r]&\pi_{n-1}(F,x_0)\arrow[r]&...
\end{tikzcd}
\]
\end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}
From this theorem, we can already calculated a not so obvious homotopy group
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!5!white,colframe=green!30!white]
\begin{corollary}
$\pi_3(S^2)\cong \mathbb{Z}$
\end{corollary}
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{proof}
    We have the exact sequence from the hopf fibration
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
    \pi_3(S^1)=0\arrow[r]&\pi_3(S^3)\cong \mathbb{Z}\arrow[r]&\pi_3(S^2)\arrow[r]&\pi_2(S^1)=0
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    where the triviality of the two groups on the end follows from Corollary $0.1.1$; $\pi_3(S^3)\cong \mathbb{Z}$ follows from Corollary $1.2.1$
\end{proof}
 

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!30!white]
\begin{theorem}
(Fiber replacement)Every map $f: X\to Y$ can be turned into a fibration in the following sense: there exists a space $E_f$ in 
\end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!30!white]
\begin{theorem}
(Puppe Sequence) Given a fibration $F\to E\to B$, we have the following sequence where any two consecutive maps form a fibration
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
    ...\arrow[r]&\Omega^2B\arrow[r]&\Omega F\arrow[r]&\Omega E\arrow[r]&\Omega B\arrow[r]&F\arrow[r]&E\arrow[r]&B
\end{tikzcd}
\]
where continuing to the left is applying the loop space functor.
\end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!30!white]
\begin{theorem}
    (Universal Coefficient Theorem) Given a coefficient group $G$, We have a split short exact sequence
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
    0\arrow[r]& \textbf{Ext}^1_{\mathbb{Z}}(H_{n-1}(X;\mathbb{Z}),G) \arrow[r]&H^n(X;G)\arrow[r]&\textbf{Hom}(H_n(X;\mathbb{Z}),G)\arrow[r]&0
    \end{tikzcd}\]
\end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!5!white,colframe=green!30!white]
\begin{corollary}
$\textrm{rank}(H_n)=\textrm{rank}(H^n)$ and $\textrm{Torsion}(H_{n-1})=\textrm{Torsion}(H^n)$
\end{corollary}
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Serre Spectral Sequence}
For the following discussions, we will use the assumption that $B$ is simply connected and work over $R=\mathbb{Z}$ to simplify things. 
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=purple!5!white,colframe=purple!75!black]
\begin{definition}
Given a Serre fibration $F\hookrightarrow X\to B$, with fiber $F$ path-connected and base $B$ simply-connected. Then, the \underline{\textbf{Serre cohomological spectral sequence}} is given by the $E_2$ page
\[
E_2^{p,q}=H ^{p}(B; H ^{q}(F; \mathbb{Z})) \Longrightarrow H ^{p+q}(X; \mathbb{Z})
\]
\end{definition}
\end{tcolorbox}
If the space $B$ is not simply connected, then the coefficient group $H ^{q}(F)$ is actually the local system on $B$ given by the fibers. This reduces to the integral cohomology when the action of $\pi_1(B)$ on the fibers are trivial.


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!30!white]
\begin{theorem}
(Product Structure) The Serre cohomological spectral sequence has a bigraded $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra structure, given by the product 
\[
E_n^{p,q}\times E_n^{s,t}\to E_n ^{p+s,q+t}
\]
In particular, the product structure on $E_2$ page is given by the cup product, and the product on $E_n$ induces the one on $E_{n+1}$.
\end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!30!white]
\begin{proposition}
    The differentials $d_n: E_n ^{p,q}\to E_n ^{p+n, q-n+1}$ is a graded derivation with respect to the product structure. In other words, given $a\in E_n ^{p,q}$ and $b\in E_n^{s,t}$, we have 
    \[
        d_n(ab)=d_n(a)b+(-1)^{|p+q|}ad_n(b) 
    \]
\end{proposition}
\end{tcolorbox}
We are ready to compute $\pi_4(S^3)$.

\section{Computations}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white,colframe=red!30!white]
\begin{theorem}
    $\pi_4(S^3)\cong \mathbb{Z}/2$.
\end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}
We know $\mathbb{Z}=H^3(S^3;\mathbb{Z})=[S^3,K(\mathbb{Z},3)]=\pi_3(K(\mathbb{Z},3))$. In particular, we may choose a map $f: S^3\to K(\mathbb{Z},3)$ representing the generator of the group. Note that by construction, $f_*: \pi_3(S^3)\to \pi_3(K(\mathbb{Z},3))$ is an isomorphism. Let $F_f$ be the homotopy fiber of $f$,

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!30!white]
\begin{proposition}
$H_4(F_f)\cong \pi_4(S^3)$; $H_3(F)=H_2(F)=0$.
\end{proposition}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}
We have the the long exact sequence 
\[ ...\pi_{n+1}(K(\mathbb{Z},3))\to\pi_n(F_f)\to \pi_n(S^3)\to \pi_n(K(\mathbb{Z},3))\to...\]
For $n=3$, we note $\pi_{4}(K(\mathbb{Z},3))$ is trivial, and $\pi_n(S^3)\to \pi_n(K(\mathbb{Z},3))$ is an isomorphism, so $\pi_3(F_f)$ must be trivial; similar argument shows $\pi_n(F_f)$ is trivial for $0<n\leq 3$ by corollary $1.1.1$ and the fact that $\pi_k(K(\mathbb{Z},3))\neq 0$ iff $k=3$. Thus, $F_f$ is $3$-connected. Note that the long exact sequence at degree $4$ also gives us the isomorphism $\pi_4(F_f)\cong \pi_4(S^3)$. Apply Hurewicz Theorem gives us the desired result.
\end{proof}

We may extend the fiber sequence one step to the left, which is the next step in the Puppe sequence $\Omega K(\mathbb{Z},3)=K(\mathbb{Z},2)\to F_f\to S^3$. Our goal now is to use the spectral sequence to calculate the cohomology of $F_f$ using the the cohomology of $S^3$ and $K(\mathbb{Z},2)$, which is realized as $\mathbb{CP}^{\infty}$. 

Recall that the cohomology ring of $\mathbb{CP}^{\infty}$ is $\mathbb{Z}[v]$, with $|v|=2$. The $E_2$ page of the Serre spectral sequence looks like the following 

\adjustbox{scale=0.6,center}{%
\begin{tikzcd}
	&& {...} \\
	& \bullet \\
	4 && {H^0(S^3,H^4(\mathbb{CP}^{\infty}))} &&& {H^3(S^3,H^4(\mathbb{CP}^{\infty}))} \\
	3 \\
	2 && {H^0(S^3,H^2(\mathbb{CP}^{\infty}))} &&& {H^3(S^3,H^2(\mathbb{CP}^{\infty}))} \\
	1 \\
	0 && {H^0(S^3,H^0(\mathbb{CP}^{\infty}))} &&& {H^3(S^3,H^0(\mathbb{CP}^{\infty}))} \\
	& \bullet &&&&&& \bullet \\
	&& 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & {}
	\arrow[from=8-2, to=8-8]
	\arrow[from=8-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=5-3, to=7-6]
	\arrow[from=3-3, to=5-6]
	\arrow[from=1-3, to=3-6]
\end{tikzcd}
}

Note that the coefficients $H^n(\mathbb{CP}^{\infty})\cong \mathbb{Z}$ in all degrees, so all the non-trivial cohomologies in the $E_2$ page are all in fact $\mathbb{Z}$; Let $1$ denote the generator for $E_2^{0,0}$ and $k$ denote the generator for $E_2^{3,0}$; the generator for $E_2^{0,2n}$ is $v^n$ as the generator for the coefficient group $H^4(\mathbb{CP}^{\infty})$. By the product structure, the generator for $E_2^{3,2}$ is simply $vk$, for the multiplication map is just multiplication of coefficients.
\adjustbox{scale=0.8,center}{%
\begin{tikzcd}
	4 & \bullet & {\mathbb{Z}v^2} \\
	3 \\
	2 && {\mathbb{Z}v} &&& {\mathbb{Z}vk} \\
	1 \\
	0 && {\mathbb{Z}1} &&& {\mathbb{Z}k} \\
	& \bullet &&&& \bullet \\
	&& 0 & 1 & 2 & 3
	\arrow[from=6-2, to=1-2]
	\arrow[from=6-2, to=6-6]
	\arrow[from=3-3, to=5-6]
	\arrow[from=1-3, to=3-6]
\end{tikzcd}
}
A quick examination of the spectral seqeunce above shows that the $d_2$ differentials are all trivial by degree reasons. Therefore, all cohomologies survive to $E_3$ page.

Note that a quick application of UCT and Proposition $3.1$ shows that $H^3(F_f)=0$. In particular, we see that $d_3: E_3^{0,2}\to E_3^{3,0}$ must be an isomorphism since both cohomology cannot survive to the next page. WLOG, we may assume $d_3(v)=k$. Then by the derivation law, we see that $d_3: E_3^{0,4}\to E_3^{3,2}$ is given by $d_3(v^2)=d_3(v)v+vd_3(v)=2vk$, so $H^4(F_f)=E_4^{0,4}=0$. Since there is nothing on $E_3^{6,0}$, we see that $H^5(F_f)=E_4^{3,2}=\mathbb{Z}vk/(2vk)\cong \mathbb{Z}/2 \mathbb{Z}$. An application of Corollary $1.6.1$ finishes.
